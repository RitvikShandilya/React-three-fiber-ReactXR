There are 4 properties to transform objects
1. position
2. scale
3. rotation
4. quaternion

All classes that inherit from Object3D possess properties like PerspectiveCamera or MeshBasicMaterial

OBJECT3D -> CAMERA -> PERSPECTIVECAMERA
OBJECT3D -> MESH

Position is a Vector3

console.log(mesh.position.length());
Above is to calculate the dist between center of screenand our object

console.log(mesh.position.distanceTo(camera.position)); // from camera to object

Positioning things in space can be difficult, we can use AxesHelper for it

Rotation auto change quarternon and vice versa
