//React three fiber

//Harder to debug because of complexity of abstraction
//three.js integrates well with react, thanks to react three fiber
// jsx is a tag based language like html
// In react the data automatically changes on UI, that is the data "reacts"
// react threee fiber is a react renderer
//the react three fiber renderer takes jsx and compiles it into a threejs scene
//DREI is a goldmine of premade components
//React is a library, not a framework, Both frameworks and libraries are precoded support programs to develop complex software applications. However, libraries target a specific functionality, while a framework tries to provide everything required to develop a complete application.
